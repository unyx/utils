![Dev warning](http://s7.postimg.org/6cruwesi3/Nyx.png)

Contains various utilities which are aimed at common day-to-day operations within PHP - dealing with arrays, strings,
the filesystem etc.

All classes in this package are static by design. Aside from how you would normally extend a static class, all of them
can also be dynamically extended with methods (names -> callables) at runtime if you want to use them at the core
of a larger project where others might want to provide additional functionality as well.

-----

### Requirements

- PHP 7.0+

Specific classess may have specific requirements outlined in their descriptions (see `utils\Str` for an example).
Dependency checks are **not** put in place to keep the overhead as small as possible.

### Installation

The only supported way of installing this package is using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

- Add `nyx/utils` as a dependency to your project's `composer.json` file.
- Run `composer update` and you're ready to go.

### Documentation

The code is fully inline documented for the time being. Online documentation will be made available in due time.
