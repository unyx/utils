/**
 * Extendable
 *
 * An Extendable object is one that can be dynamically extended with additional methods during runtime.
 *
 * If you extend the object with Closures instead of other callables, remember that you can also bind them
 * to the scope ($this) of the object you're extending, giving you easier access to it. While it is possible
 * to automatically invoke extending Closures in this scope, the decision about the scope is by design left
 * to the extension, also to provide consistency with other types of callables for which this is not possible.
 *
 * Do, however, note that this relies on the magic __call() method which introduces considerable overhead
 * for each call, especially for very simple code. If possible, extend the exhibitors of this trait casually
 * to avoid the performance hit.
