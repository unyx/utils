/**
 * Random
 *
 * Utilities for generating and dealing with (pseudo-)random values.
 *
 * --- Strength
 *
 * All methods in this class can be called with a strength setting, being one of the STRENGTH_* class
 * constants and STRENGTH_MEDIUM being the default for each method.
 *
 *   - STRENGTH_STRONG is cryptographically secure but may be the slowest setting;
 *   - STRENGTH_MEDIUM is cryptographically secure and can be safely used for generating keys and salts;
 *   - STRENGTH_WEAK is *not* cryptographically secure but should be used in a non-crypto context for
 *     generating randomized values (it's the fastest out of the settings);
 *   - STRENGTH_NONE is *absolutely not* cryptographically secure - it should only be used is a context
 *     with absolutely no relation to encryption or authentication. Currently it only affects Random::string()
 *     in that this method will use str_shuffle() instead of generating a string based on a stronger
 *     pseudo-random seed (which is, simply, considerably faster);
 *
 * Important note: This class *is not* a cryptography class and does not perform any sort of mixing
 * of the generated values. For stronger input vectors for actual encryption algorithms you may want
 * to employ a mixing strategy for the data generated by this class before signing it off.
 *
 * In some situations, for instance when a weak random integer is sufficient, for performance reasons you
 * may be better off simply using mt_rand() (which is also used by self::int() if called with STRENGTH_WEAK) -
 * this class does however provide a consistent API and error handling to ensure nothing silently fails
 * leading to security holes.
 *
 * --- Sources
 *
 * This class is primarily a strict wrapper around PHP's native random_bytes() and random_int() functions,
 * which make use of the following sources:
 *   - Windows: CryptGenRandom() (only)
 *   - Others: arc4random_buf(), then /dev/arandom, then /dev/urandom
 *
 * The first valid source in those orders gets used. In the edge case where that procedure fails,
 * this class throws exceptions instead of simply returning false like random_bytes() does but attempts
 * two (by default) additional fallbacks first (in this order):
 *   - openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(), if available (which uses a userspace hash algo making it
 *     potentially an additional point of failure and thus only valid for the STRENGTH_MEDIUM setting
 *     and below);
 *   - mcrypt_create_iv(), if available (which basically uses the exact same sources as random_bytes()
 *     although in a slightly different execution process, so it's merely a second attempt at doing what
 *     random_bytes() should've done);
 *
 * No additional userspace entropy sources are used nor introduced by this utility. Libsodium may be
 * introduced as additional primary fallback at a later date.
 *
 * The fallback mechanism is lazily instantiated - unless PHP's native functions fail us, there will
 * be minimal overhead of using this class over random_bytes() directly, but with added verbosity.
 *
 * --- Others
 *
 * Based on Anthony Ferrara's work on RandomLib {@see https://github.com/ircmaxell/RandomLib}.
 *
 * If you need an utility for generating random/fake real-world data, you should take a look
 * at Faker {@see https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker}. This functionality is beyond the scope
 * of this utility.
